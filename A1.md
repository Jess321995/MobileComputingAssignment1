## 1. [IKEA Place](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inter_ikea.place&hl=en) 
## 1.1 Description
IKEA Place is an interactive home furnishing application available on Android and IOS platforms. It allows its users to view the furniture catalog and visualize how it would look and feel in their own house. Users can search for any furniture by either typing its name or browsing through the side menus. It also provides an option to capture images of any furniture and find similar products on IKEA. Figure 1.1.1 shows how accurately the light lamp was identified by the app and similar lamps were suggested for purchase.

I have chosen this application as it very interesting and cool. IKEA, the furniture giant, has innovatively used Augmented Reality to boost its online sales. The app has completely revolutionized furniture retail. 
Buying furniture that gives the room a cohesive look is never an easy task. Sometimes individual furniture pieces look pretty at the store but when bought home, they don’t fit in. This is when IKEA Place app comes handy. We can finalize the furniture in the comfort of our home. The user simply has to face the camera on the floor so that the room’s size can be estimated[3]. The 3-D models of furniture are then projected in the real environment so that we can see how the room would look like. The best thing is that the furniture is true-to-scale and we can walk around the furniture as if it is actually present in our room. Figure 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 shows how we can place the furniture and have a look at it from different angles. This next-to-real experience is amusing. It is also possible to share these personally created interior designs with others through Whatsapp or other apps. 

IKEA App uses Augmented Reality to enhance the shopping experience of the user. The phone’s camera sensors are used to scale the products to its true size (98% accurate)[2]. The app also makes use of visual search technology and artificial intelligence for image search[4].

The strengths of this app are that it is intuitive and easy to use. It supports multiple languages and has audio cues. It measures the lighting of the room and then creates shadow formations which make the whole setup a lot more realistic. We can also go near the projected models of the furniture and have a look at the texture of its material. Consider figure 1.1.3 where we can clearly see the material of the wooden cabinet. This enhances the overall experience. The major weakness of this app is that it redirects the user to the IKEA website for placing an order. There is no provision to place orders from within the app. Also, if we keep minimize the application and resume it, the app does not scale the products properly. 

There are some improvements that can be made in terms of functionality and performance. The app should allow users to place an order directly from within the app. Also, some additional features like curated home furnishing collections, product description within the app itself, etc would attract more users.

## 2. [Google Tez (now known as Google Pay India)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.paisa.user&hl=en)
## 2.1 Description
Google Pay India is a popular UPI based money transfer application launched specifically for the Indian users.[5] It allows users to make money transfers with nearby devices without the need of having an NFC chip on their device. Users can also scan QR Code, make payments to people on their contact list or use bank account details for transferring funds.

I have chosen this application as it has revolutionized digital payment in India. Before the launch of Google Pay, we had to keep different bank applications on the phone for every bank account we had. But now we can manage multiple bank accounts using a single application. Also the app is very innovative as it makes use of ultrasonic sound to transfer money to a nearby device.[7]

Users have several reasons to use Google Pay. Service charges levied on the users for bank-to-bank transfers are waivered off by the use of this app. In addition, users are given rewards in the form of scratch card on every transaction which is directly deposited to the users account. Google Pay is directly connected to the bank account of the user and this eradicates the concept of mobile wallet. This means that users need not worry about reloading their e-wallets. The app requires you to enter a security pattern or PIN to unlock it and before making any transaction which ensures that it cannot be misused by anyone. It is an all in one application which allows users to recharge mobile phones, pay bills, make online payments, etc. Users can also view how much money they have spent. Users can also chat with their friends and request money through the chats.

Google Pay makes use of Audio QR technology to transfers funds with nearby devices using ultrasonic sound.[7] The sending and receiving devices pair with each other using sound waves that are inaudible to the human ears. Also, Google Pay is built on top of a Unified Payments Interface (UPI) that was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India.[7] The UPI system allows secure inter-bank transfers to take place on a single mobile platform.[8]
The strength of this application is that it provides us a single platform to manage all our bank accounts in one single place. It supports multiple languages as well. All transactions take place instantaneously at the click of a button and the whole process is absolutely hassle-free. Also, merchants, businesses and organizations can create a custom payment channel through Google Pay and send messages to the user for upcoming event ticket purchase, recharge reminders, etc.[6] The weakness of this app is that it does not allow you to transfer funds from an Indian bank to a non-Indian bank. Also, it does not allow you to add two bank accounts that have different mobile numbers associated with them.

There are some improvements and features that could be added to this application. Google Pay presently allows users to add multiple bank accounts associated with the same mobile number. However, it can be improved by allowing users to perform international transfers.

The app can be downloaded from Google play store using the below link https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.paisa.user&hl=en
